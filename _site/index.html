                As I said earlier, Foundation is a full blown framework, along the same lines as Twitter Bootstrap.  You get the grid system, but also navigation elements, buttons, forms, controls of all different kinds, alerts, drop-downs, and on and on.  But for the purposes of this comparison, I wanted to concentrate primarily on the grid system.

            Foundation also provides a lot of tools for handling nesting, offsets, incomplete rows, and other potential gotchas that really look great for helping to manage the grid.

            Given that you get a lot of other features with it, like forms, alerts, drop-downs, etc, I am really starting to look forward to using Foundation more in the future.
